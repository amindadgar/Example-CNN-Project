# Example-CNN-Project
This is a simple project showing how to implement deep neural networks using CNN algorithm. <br>
The dataset is taken from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images

## Additional Notes
The model is not really accurate because the dataset was not a generalized dataset, But this code is a good example of how to implement deep learning with tensorflow and also how to load the model.
